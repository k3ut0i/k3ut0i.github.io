One of the first things i asked Myself when i wanted to start a blog was, Why? What purpose does it serve? Well, i just want to pass on what other blogs did for me. Many tools, scripts and hacks that i had a problem with which could not be resolved by docs etc... are resolved by blog posts, examples and experiences.

Hence the blog. This is a collection of all such things that helped me and a few additions of my own. Many of my posts may copy from other blog but i shall strive to give credit where it is due.

What? Well what do i blog about? Mostly Computers, Linux, Arch, Games, Electronics.
