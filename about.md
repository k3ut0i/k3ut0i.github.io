About Me
========
I'm Keutoi. <img style="float: right" src="https://gravatar.com/avatar/1b0f4404b6fc8995cd6fea10b5c8b09c">
It's an alias but works online i suppose. I just completed my Bachelor's in
Electrical Engineering. I like learning new technologies, reading fantasy and some parts of pure mathematics
and computer science. Most of my blog entries will be about these topics.

Disclaimer
==========
*   Language:   Though i've been studying in english as my medium of instruction for last 15 years,
    i haven't written much so my language maybe a bit crude with grammatical and spellingg errors.
    So any feedback is appreciated.
*   Content:    Some theoretical or technical content will be from some book, website or another
    blog. I will try to give credit where it is due. In case you don't feel the same about any post
    please let me know.
